\section*{Abstract}
An abstract contains a brief summary of a written document. It should fulfill the purpose of informing the reader of the paper's purpose and key findings.
\end{abstract}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Introduction}

We begin with the introduction by using the 
\verb|\section{Introduction}| command.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Generalities}

We continue with the next section using \verb|\section{Generalities}|. For an in-depth introduction to \LaTeX\ please refer to e.g. ~\cite{Kopka:1} (German book) or ~\cite{IntroLateX:08} (English PDF document).

If you need German "Umlaute" then please generate them with the following commmands: \verb|{\"a}|, \verb|{\"A}|, \verb|{\"o}|, \verb|{\"O}|, \verb|{\"u}|, \verb|{\"U}|. The German "{\ss}" can be generated by using the command \verb|{\ss}|.

All required (additional) packets have to be included by using the \verb|\usepackage{}| command at the beginning of the \LaTeX\ File. Please make sure to include standard packets only, such that the global layout and appearance remain unaltered.

\section{Special Issues}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Mathematical Expressions and Equations}

Mathematical expressions and equations should be generated as e.g. stated in \cite[Kapitel 5]{Kopka:1}. 

The following equation is given by
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:equation_01}
   a = \frac{b}{c}\;,	% please consider equations as part of a sentence!
\end{equation}
and can be be referenced by \eqref{eq:equation_01}.

This paragraph was generated using the following \LaTeX\ source code:
\begin{verbatim}
The following equation is given by
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:equation_01}
   a = \frac{b}{c}\;,	% please treat equations as part of the sentence!
\end{equation}
and can be be referenced by \eqref{eq:equation_01}.
\end{verbatim}

Please use unambiguous labels!

In the template, some commands such as \verb|\R|, \verb|\Z|, \verb|\N|, \verb|\C|, and \verb|\Q| have already been defined. These commands generate the set symbols $\R$, $\Z$, $\N$, $\C$, and $\Q$, when the \LaTeX\ math mode is used. For  e.g. finite fields the symbol is $\F$ (generated by \verb+\F+) is provided. These predefined commands should be used.

In order to avoid confusing scalar, vector, or matrix variables, please stick to the following, well established rules:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Functions and other text are represented using a ``roman'' font. The corresponding 			command is \verb|\textrm{...}|.
	\item Scalar variables are represented using an ``italic'' font, which is the standard font for 			the \LaTeX\ math environment.
	\item Vectors should be represented by small, bold print italic letters. To this end, the command 
	\verb|\ve{...}| has been predefined.
	\item Matrices should be represented by capital, bold print italic letters. Again, the \verb|\ve{...}|
	command should be used to generate such symbols.
\end{itemize}

A further equation illustrating the Froebenius--Norm of an $M\times N$--dimensional matrix $\ve{A}$ is given by
\def\defeq{\stackrel{\mbox{\footnotesize def}}{=}}	
\begin{align}\label{eq:equation_02}
\|\ve{A}\|_{\mathrm{F}}^2 &\defeq  \sum_{m=1}^M \sum_{n=1}^N |a_{m,n}|^2 \;,\nonumber \\
&= \mathrm{spur}\left( \ve{A}\ve{A}^\mathsf{H} \right) \;.
\end{align}
This equation was generated using
\begin{verbatim}
% at first, we define the equation symbol with def on top
\def\defeq{\stackrel{\mbox{\footnotesize def}}{=}}	
% then we state the equation
\begin{align}\label{eq:equation_02}
\|\ve{A}\|_{\mathrm{F}}^2 
&\defeq \sum_{m=1}^M \sum_{n=1}^N |a_{m,n}|^2 \;,	\nonumber \\
&= \mathrm{spur}\left( \ve{A}\ve{A}^\mathsf{H} \right) \;.
\end{align}
\end{verbatim}

The \verb+\nonumber+ command suppresses the equation number in the first line of \eqref{eq:equation_02}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Figures}

Figures should be generated as .pdf files, and included into the document by employing the \verb+\includegraphics+ command.
Each figure should be combined with a concise caption, describing the figure's contents.
A typical example of a figure in a floating environment (used in pdfLaTeX) is generated by the following code:
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{figures/example}
\end{center}
\caption{This is an example figure according to \cite{Example09}.}
\label{fig:example}
\end{figure}
\end{verbatim}
% Here is the figure input
\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{figures/example}
\end{center}
\caption{This is an example figure according to \cite{Example09}.}
\label{fig:example}
\end{figure}

It is often desirable to replace sequences of letters from the original figure source file by other, possibly more appropriate abbreviations, words, or symbols. This can be achieved by using the  \verb+\pstool+ environment, which has been employed for generating Fig.~\ref{fig:example2}.  The \verb+\pstool+ environment converts an .eps (!) file (here: example2.eps) into a .pdf file, which is included in the final document. 

In this example, the letters \emph{U} and \emph{M}, as well as the German word \emph{Mobiltelefone} have been replaced by more fitting descriptions. As a prerequisite, all text symbols have to be embedded as text in the original figure .eps file. 

Fig.~\ref{fig:example2} has been generated with the following code:
\begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
    \pstool*[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/example2}{
         \psfrag{U}[l][l]{Unicast cells}
    \psfrag{M}[l][l]{Multicast cells}
    \psfrag{Mobiltelefone}[l][l]{UEs}
         }
    \caption{An example for using the \textrm{pstool} environment.}
    \label{fig:example2}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{figure}[htb]
\begin{center}
\pstool*[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/example2}{
  \psfrag{U}[l][l]{Unicast cells}
  \psfrag{M}[l][l]{Multicast cells}
  \psfrag{Mobiltelefone}[l][l]{UEs}
}
\caption{An example for using the \textrm{pstool} environment.}
\label{fig:example2}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
\end{verbatim}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Tables}
Tables are often required to provide a collective overview of used or generated data, such as e.g. a table illustrating simulation parameters. The following table is referenced by Tab.~\ref{tab:Table_01} and uses the table (floating) environment in combination with the tabular environment.
\begin{table}[htb]
\caption{A table example.}\label{tab:Table_01}
\centering\begin{tabular}{ll} \toprule
	Parameter    & Values \\
	\midrule
	Parameter 1 & value 1 \\
	Parameter 2 & Value 2 \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{The List of References}
At the end of this article, a list of references has to be included. This can achieved by either using
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{thebibliography}{whatever you want to write here}
\bibitem[Fis07]{Fischer:07}
R.\ Fischer: \emph{seminar.tex}, LIT, Uni Erlangen, Juli 2007.
\end{thebibliography}
\end{verbatim}
or
\begin{verbatim}
\bibliography{mein_bib_file}
\bibliographystyle{alpha}
\end{verbatim}
References to literature in the text are included by the \verb|\cite{...}| command. For example, the command
\verb|\cite{Fischer:07q}| would result in [Fis07].

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Conclusions}
Your article should not be missing a final statement containing some conclusions which can be drawn from your work. A reference to e.g. future work is also in order.
